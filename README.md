# Flight-Fare-Prediction
A Web Application takes user's travel details and predicts expetcted fare.
>
**#How it works**
1. A Machine Learning model works for the prediction process.
2. Basically, it takes some details from the user as input parameters, and after processing from them,shows the predicted expected output.
3. And, Input parameters are: Date of travel, Flight Details, No. of stoppages in the journey.
4. As we have trained a machine learning model, already by feeding it the well processed, processable data. So, all the input parameters are fed to the model
    And after processing it shows the expected predicted output .
